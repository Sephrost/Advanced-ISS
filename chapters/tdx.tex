\chapter{Intel Trusted Domain Extensions}

\section{Introduction}

Confidential computing aims to provide protection for data in the
enterprise and cloud environment (data in use). \\ 
Intel SGX is the first solution from Intel, and introduces the ability
to compute user applications in a protected memory space, enforcing a
strong division between platform provider and other tenants
(enclaves). This paradigm is called \textbf{confidential computing}.
Intel TDX is an architectural technology to deploy hardware-isolated
VMS called \textbf{Trusted Domains}, isolated from the Virtual Machine
Manager, Hypervisor and other non-TD software on the host platform. \\ 
Intel TDX was introduced in 2021 and was included in Intel's 4th
Generation Xeon Scalable Processors in 2023.

  \label{fig:tdx boundaries}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:tdx boundaries}, we can see 3 levels of boundaries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No protection} at all, all the elements can
    potential access confidential data.
  \item VM protection with \textbf{TDX}, which provide protection
    and isolation for all the part related to the virtualised
    environment.
  \item VM protection with \textbf{SGX}, that provide security,
    mostly for data confidentiality (the memory storage and
    just a part of the execution environment with the enclave)
\end{itemize}

\section{Secure Arbitration Mode (SEAM)}

To help enforce the security policies for Trusted Domains, and to
support Intel TDX module, a new CPU mode called \textbf{Secure
Arbitration Mode}(SEAM) has been introduced.\\ 
SEAM hosts an Intel-provided, digitally-signed but not encrypted,
security service module. \smallskip

The Intel-TDX module, when activated, is hosted in a reserved memory
space identified by the \textbf{SEAM-range register (SEAMRR)}. \\ 
The CPU allows access to the SEAM memory range exclusively to software
executing inside the SEAM range itself, while excluding all other
software and Direct Memory Access (DMA). \smallskip

SEAM is also designed to avoid any memory access privileges to other
protected memory regions in the platform. Furthermore, all CPUs
capable of SEAM mode are compatible with Intel TDX.

\section{Intel TDX Architecture}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/intel tdx arch.png}
  \caption{Intel TDX Architecture}
  \label{fig:tdx arch}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:tdx arch}, you can see a schema showing the
isolation between the normal mode (on the left) and the TDX mode (on
the right), which is in charge of deploying as a secure interface for
the VMM, the various secure virtual machines called \textbf{TD}. \\
This is done through the help with the help of secure page tables, and
memory encryption keys.

\section{Intel TDX Module Tasks \& Instructions}

The \textbf{SEAMCALL} instruction places the CPU in
\textit{SEAM-VMX-root} operation and invokes the installation of the
TDX module, which provides a secure interface to the Virtual Machine
Manager (VMM) for managing TDs. Acting as a trusted intermediary, the
Intel TDX module helps enforce security policies, perform actions, and
apply necessary mitigations for TDs, more practically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It prevents VMM and hypervisor or untrusted entities from
    accessing registers, performance counters, etc.
  \item It saves and scrubs register states during TD exits to prevent
    data leakage (state preservation and memory sanitification).
  \item Allows VMM to restrict features for each TD.
\end{itemize}

For remote attestation, the \textbf{SEAMREPORT} instruction is
employed to create cryptographic reports. \\ 
The \textbf{SEAMRET} instruction in introduced to securely returns
control to the VMM.


\section{TDX capabilities}
Some of the capabilities of Intel TDX are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Memory Confidentiality and Integrity
  \item Address-Translation Integrity
  \item CPU-State Confidentiality and Integrity
  \item Remote Attestation
  \item VM preserving updates
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory Confidentiality and Integrity}
TDX adopt \textbf{MKTME} (Multi Key Total Memory Encryption) for
provide memory confidentiality protection with AES-128-XTS- (or
256).\\
It can operate in 2 modes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{cryptographic-integrity scheme:} It's the more secure
    one, that use a SHA-3-256 hash (\textit{truncated to 28bit !}) for
    each cache line (64KB) in addition to the encryption. It also have
    a 1-bit TD ownership tag for each cache line that indicates when a
    cache line is associated with a memory page assigned to a TD.
  \item \textbf{Logical-integrity mode:} Used for cache line that
    don't need cryptographic integrity protection, it only use the TD
    ownership tag.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Managment}
There are 3 main keys used by TDX:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Memory Encryption Key}: As alredy seen, is an
    AES-128-XTS-Ephemeral (or 256) key used to encrypt the memory of
    each TD. It is identified by a unique \textbf{KeyID} (HKID)
    specific for each TD, and can be used only by TDX module and CPU.
    KeyID can refer also to public keys used in shared memory portions
    external to TDs.
  \item \textbf{MAC key}: It used only by the CPU to provide integrity
    protection to the TD measurements report with HMAC-SHA-384.
  \item\textbf{ Attestation key}: (ECDSA 384) Used to sign the
    attestation report, it's generated and managed by the SGX
    TD-quoting enclave that is the only one who has access to it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Address-Translation Integrity}
Each TD have access to 2 class of memory, a private one that holds the
confidential data for the TD, and a shared one used to communicate
with untrusted entities. \\ 
Both the type of memory have the MSB of the gust-physical address
designed as a "Shared" bit, to indicates if the memory is shared (0)
or private (1). \\
Moreover, the VMM helps allocate and map memory used by the TDs into
the guest physical address to translate them in the host physical
addresses of the platform using extended page tables (EPT). There are
2 types of EPT, a secure one that is in charge of providing the
translation for the private part of the memory for each TD and a
shared one related to the public part of the memory (See figure
\ref{fig:addrs transalation integrity}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/addrs transalation integrity.png}
    \caption{Address Translation Integrity}
    \label{fig:addrs transalation integrity}
\end{figure}

The CPU prevents a TD from locating page table structure and
executable confidential code in the shared memory by causing page
faults in case of errors. \\ 
Intel TDX has also a tracking system for the extended page tables that
is the physical address metadata table and it helps secure page table
of a TD to not be allocated in another secure extended page table of
another TD.


\subsection{CPU-State Confidentiality and Integrity}
When a TD is created, the module for Intel TDX would require the VMM
to provide a set of memory pages to be used to host the
virtual-machine-control-structures (VMCS). \\
The goal of the module is to use its page-allocation trackers to
enforce that these pages have not been simultaneously assigned to
other TDs by the VMM. \\
The Intel-TDX module would then initialize and configure these
structures using the TD-assigned, private key to help provide
cryptographic confidentiality and integrity protection to the TD-CPU
state.


\subsection{Remote Attestation}
Remote attestation is the process that helps a relying party be sure
that a software is running on a TD, on a genuine system at a given
level of security. TD has two types of measurement register:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{MRTD}: (measurement register for TD) Provide static
    measurements for the TD during the build process and contains also
    the configuration of it.
  \item \textbf{MTMR}: (runtime measurement register) Is an array of
    four general purpose register used for measurements made at
    runtime.
\end{itemize}
The method used to take the measurements is the same as for TCB-PCRs,
a cumulative SHA-384 hash. \\
The process start from inside the TD (with a specific instruction)
that ask to the TDX module to create a specific report structure in
which we have the measurements, configuration and measurements of the
TD, and also configuration of the TCB, so the Intel TDX module. Note
that report data value is designed to contain the nonce for the remote
attestation process to maintain its freshness. \\
The report generated with this initial part of the remote attestation
is marked with the HMAC SHA-384 key

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/report struct.png}
    \caption{Report Structure}
    \label{fig:report struct}
\end{figure}

The second part of the Remote Attestation is the generation of the
quote, that is generated by a specific Intel-SGX enclave called
TD-quoting enclave (TDQE) (is in charge of signing the report data,
the report for the TD with its own attestation key).
After the report is created, the report is passed to the TD Quoting
Enclave through the VMM, that with the instruction
\textbf{EVEIFYREPORT} in able to check the integrity of the report by
asking directly to the CPU to make it for him.  If the integrity check
is successful, the report is signed with an elliptic curve DSA-384
attestation key. NOTE: The public key certificate related to the TD
Quoting Enclave attestation key is issued and signed by Intel itself.
\bigskip

The quote verification phase can be done by any party: a relying party
or a service inside the cloud service provider. And it can be done: in
a secure way inside the Intel SGX Enclave or in an unprotected manner. 
(the verifier is in charge of verifying the measurements and the quote
and accept or not the quote).

  \label{fig:schema tdx attestation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{VM preserving updates}
Another feature is the capability of Intel TDX module, to provide
update at runtime while persisting TD state and with a minimum TD
interruption (particularly useful for cloud environment). \\
When the TCB linked to each TD will be restored, and a new TCB,
associated with the updated TDX Module, will be utilized during the
launch of the new TD(s), followed by the subsequent attestation. \\
Existing TDs and their relevant metadata state will be securely saved
in encrypted memory owned by the authenticated code module thus
protecting the secure surface. \\
TD Preserving Update Flows furnishes updates in orders of
milliseconds, this making the 99.999\% Cloud availability goal of CSPs
attainable. \\


\section{Threat Model Overview}
There are 2 main adversaries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{System software adversary:}  can be insiders of the
    platform. So developers, but also VMM BIOS, trying to execute
    malicious software to steal confidential data.
  \item \textbf{Physical adversary:} Someone that access directly
    access to the platform. That trying to perform hardware attack.
\end{itemize}
